# Conway's Game of Life in Python

A python implementation of the interesting Conway's Game of Life

## Instructions

1. Install requirements

`pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Run main file

`python main.py`

## Explanation

Conway's Game of Life is a cellular automation devised by British mathematician [*John Horton Conway*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Horton_Conway) in 1970
In this world time moves as with each iteration, and all the cells obey a set of four rules.
They are as follows

> 1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies, as if by underpopulation.
> 2. Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.
> 3. Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by overpopulation.
> 4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.
